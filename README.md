# What is Yew?
Yew is an ongoing project in functional programming combined with intuitionistic
logic and a heaping helping of category theory on top.

# Why the name?
I originally planned to make a sister language to elm, which is pure functional
programming with algebraic types that compiles to javascript. Yew was to (and
may yet) compile to the JVM, producing an algebraically typed pure functional
language with a runtime that is present on nearly every system (an
understandably ideal case)

# What does it do?
The end goals of this project are realtively undefined. They may not exist. For
the time being, the goal is to implement fully dual intuitionistic logic via
inference rules related to Gentzen's sequent calculus. Given some time, this may
evolve into a query-based computational system.
